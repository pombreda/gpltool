* iconv fixes, some extra comments

2010-10-07
* rename unpack types in the bruteforce configuration
* replace per scan specific unpack elements with a generic "unpack" element, add
type of unpack to a new element "type", which specifies the type.
* extractprogramstrings.py: strip comments first, optionally run through
iconv first, make regex more reliable
* add public domain sed script that removes C/C++ style comments

2010-09-15
* store scanned strings to Lucene

2010-09-13
* start on a program to extract strings from sourcecode

2010-09-04
* add configuration for BusyBox 1.17.2

2010-08-18
* add configurations for BusyBox 1.17.0 and 1.17.1
* fix README for appletname-extractor.py

2010-06-17
* add configuration for BusyBox 1.16.2

2010-06-09
* add preliminary support for cramfs (only tested with little endian cramfs).
Some extra work is needed to get this to work (apply a patch, rebuild a tool),
so it is disabled by default for now.

2010-06-08
* compatibility fixes for unzip 6.0

2010-06-03
* reinstate 'magic' attribute in the configuration
* tool to extract information from the XML output and add it to knowledgebase

2010-06-02
* started work on a script to take the results from the output of the
bruteforce tool and put the results into the knowledgebase

2010-06-01
* add a simple check for hostapd
* add some more stubs for integrating the knowledgebase

2010-05-10
* add a simple check for wpa_supplicant
* use data from the knowledgebase to report additional data
* add a script to initialize a knowledgebase (sqlite) , as well as several separate
scripts to maintain the knowledgebase

2010-05-09
* add a script for creating a knowledgebase and fill it with some test data

2010-05-05
* add simple checks for iptables, iproute, dproxy, ez-ipupdate
* add simple check for libusb 0.1
* add simple check for vsftpd
* move documentation to the 'doc' directory
* document adding new checks

2010-05-04
* small speedup for BusyBox (40 characters should be enough for the BusyBox
version number)
* stub for XML reporting for BusyBox, not yet used
* cleanup fsmagic.py, add markers for cpio archives
* add beginnings of tools to build and query a searchbase with a file name to
package mapping, useful for quick sweep scanning
* make the tool run silent by default (no reporting)
* add reporting of bruteforce scanning in XML (enable with -x flag)
* remove old text reporting
* add infrastructure to have custom XML snippets printed for checks that don't
fit the default XML reporting model
* add unpack code for cpio, tar, Windows executables (cabinet archive files,
7z), rar, zip
* add code to determine architecture for ELF files
* document code more

2010-05-01
* remove some calls to addDocument() in the extractkernel* scripts, since they
are unnecessary. It also brings down the size of the Lucene indexes with about
a quarter, and lets the scripts run a bit faster.

2010-04-30
* remove a marker string for U-Boot which falsely identified some instances of
CFE as possibly U-Boot

2010-04-27
* add a check for loadlin, which you can still find in some embedded devices
* speedup for BusyBox version extraction
* speedup for Linux kernel version extraction

2010-04-26
* close files when we don't need them anymore. This prevents running out of
limits for open files.

2010-04-23
* add more documentation for the bruteforce scanning tool

2010-04-21
* add first scan for U-Boot. More marker strings need to be added to make it more reliable.

2010-04-18
* remove wrong marker line for ALSA, leading to false positives
* add LZMA decompression. This is not too reliable according to Debian bug #364260

2010-04-17
* add basic pretty printing
* speedup scanning for BusyBox version number
* Python 2.5 compatibility fixes (thanks to Brett Smith)
* only check for module license strings in actual modules
* return the correct offset for finding squashfs file systems
* filter out more files, that are not immediately interesting, like HTML pages
* add the kernel checks from the kernelanalysis script to the brute force scanner

2010-04-16
* add scan for RedBoot to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for wireless tools to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for dynamically linked libraries to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for licenses in kernel modules to brute force scanning tool

2010-04-15 - initial release
