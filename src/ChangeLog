* extra sanity checks for BAT_REPORTDIR

2012-05-20
* add first version of minix unpacker to bat-extratools

2012-05-15
* files can have multiple symbols in the file tree, so make it easier to add
more symbols and decorate the file tree
* sort file tree
* decorate Android files in file tree
* big file fixes (finally!) for cramfs and cab unpacking

2012-05-14
* split data dump method, so it can be reused in the GUI more easily
* save data from scan in GUI
* rename "ranking" dir to "filereports", since it is far more accurate
* keep focus on selected file after applying filters
* keep data in tabs if selected file has not changed. Especially if there are
lots of matches, or large files in advanced mode this will save unnecessary
waiting.
* gzip unique html reports to decrease unpacking time in GUI + update GUI
* select scans from GUI

2012-05-13
* load scan configuration via the menu too
* display tags in GUI
* portability fixes, add stubs for scanning directly from interface
* launch scans via interface and display results in interface. Still to be
added: saving results, plus better filtering of scans

2012-05-12
* don't show scanning menu for non-Linux systems

2012-05-11
* cut more data from scandata.pickle that is not used in the GUI
* add very conservative tagger for GIF files
* add filter to hide (seemingly) empty directories
* portability fixes in batgui
* add list of scans from configuration file (if specified) to checkbox menu

2012-05-10
* move bruteforce scanning functionality to separate file in 'bat'
subdirectory. This will make it a lot easier to make other front ends for BAT,
for example GUI or networked service. Rework top level bruteforce.py to
reflect change.
* move some functionality that is likely not to be used much in GUI to
"advanced mode".
* unpack files that are only needed in advanced mode on the fly instead of
always. This significantly reduces waiting time when opening an archive for
viewing in "simple" mode
* enable "advanced mode" in GUI
* add more filters (resources, PDFs) to GUI

2012-05-09
* write original ranking dump data to separate pickle files. This data is
not used in the GUI directly and is just wasting memory and CPU time.
* adapt GUI to reflect change in dump data format. Also don't unpacking
'ranking' directory with new pickle files: they are not used and unpacking
takes time.
* construct file tree from scandata.pickle instead of walking the data
directory from the dump
* enable interactive filtering of file types via menu

2012-05-08
* add filtering capabilities to GUI

2012-05-07
* fix edge case in Java deserialisation
* add function name match reporting to GUI

2012-05-06
* enable function name scanning in ranking method
* fix and enable gzip verifier in prerun.py

2012-05-04
* introduce LZMA_MINIMUM_SIZE parameter to set minimum size of results of for
LZMA unpacking. This is to reduce false positives.
* add simplistic verifier for ELF files. This is to reduce false positives in
LZMA scanning.

2012-05-03
* rework bruteforce.py so it is easier to make different frontends
* introduce "enable" configuration directive. This will make it easier for a
graphical frontend to enable/disable checks

2012-05-02
* add very simplistic verifier for MP4 files to reduce false positives
further. Only works on a subset of files for now
* add first version of a graphical viewer of results made with BAT
* add stubs for extra method for scanning dynamically linked binaries, by
searching for function names. Prepare rest of the code for the change.

2012-04-24
* tagging 7.0

2012-04-18
* set a maximum size for picture generation: if file is bigger than a certain
size no picture ("tv static") will be generated.
* outcomment code for generating thumbnails for now
* set a maximum size for hexdump generation: if file is bigger than a certain
size no hexdump will be generated.

2012-04-17
* replace glob.glob() with our own filtering. This prevents os.listdir() from
being called numerous times
* very simplistic check for tagging Ogg files, needs vorbis-tools.

2012-03-29
* add a very simplistic method to tag binary XML for Android (file name check,
plus the first four bytes)

2012-03-26
* add tool to check whether or not a binary + libraries can be combined at
runtime
* replace piechart generation using external script and pychart with
matplotlib. It's faster, doesn't require an external script and better fits
the license.

2012-03-24
* remove unused and no longer maintained file

2012-03-21
* pass size hints, if available

2012-03-19
* also pass top level scan directory to postrunscans

2012-03-18
* add code to determineinformation about correlation between packages for
non-unique matches.

2012-03-11
* move the unpacking to a directory called 'data'. Dump the state of the
program in a pickle so it can be read back for later use.
* remove hardcoded paths from the data that is pickled. This makes it easier
to relocate the results for future processing.

2012-03-08
* add script that uses hexdump -Cv to generate files to be used in a GUI. It's
faster than writing our own.

2012-03-01
* revive knowledgebase idea, but now as a pretty printer

2012-02-28
* make pretty printer configurable

2012-02-27
* rework BusyBox configuration extraction: some things could be done a lot
easier and also give better results.
* add romfs unpacking using romfsck. Not enabled by default, since it needs
some more cleanups
* add romfsck to bat-extratools

2012-02-26
* work around standard behaviour in xgettext that caused strings to be not
extracted

2012-02-24
* split caching database per language family
* determine version based on strings extracted from the binary
* determine licenses based on strings extracted from the binary plus a large
database of licenses extracted from source code using Ninka

2012-02-23
* start moving maintenance scripts into the 'maintenance' directory
* add code to generate images of files

2012-02-22
* add plugin that queries a database with packages extracted from sources from
distributions

2012-02-21
* several cleanups, remove unnecessary calls and conversions

2012-02-19
* correctly process scans that don't define "noscan"
* introduce environment variable to indicate whether or not there is a fully
generated caching database
* inline some code in ranking.py, reducing memory consumption

2012-02-18
* pass environment variables to XML pretty printing methods

2012-02-15
* remove use of dynamic symbols in ranking.py, to decrease false positives

2012-01-30
* add uncompression of compress'd files
* tagging 6.0

2012-01-23
* avoid duplicate license scanning

2012-01-22
* actually make a copy of the environment, to prevent "Argument list too long"
errors

2012-01-20
* determine the size of JFFS2 file systems
* remove limit of JFFS2 scanning (whole file). JFFS2 file systems can now also
be carved from the middle of a file.
* return order in which identifiers are found. This is not yet used.

2012-01-19
* big file fixes for byteswapping
* rework identifiers for .exe files
* big file fixes for PDF files

2012-01-16
* add lrzip unpacking
* enable cramfs checking by default
* add another squashfs variant (from DD-WRT)

2012-01-14
* prepare for 6.0 release
* fix bugs in RPM unpacking

2012-01-13
* further preprocess strings that go into the database. Specifically we split
on strings that 'strings' will split on when reading a binary file
* remove control characters in escaped form at the start of a string
* make multiprocessing configurable in the configuration

2012-01-10
* don't run leaf scans on duplicate files. Instead run the scans just once and
recombine the results later.

2012-01-09
* don't unnecessarily run program scans and postrun scans if none are defined
in the configuration
* only pass the configuration of the program scans to the program scans. This
can save a lot of memory for big runs.

2012-01-04
* add infrastructure for postrun scans

2012-01-03
* parallellise unpacking. Hardcoded to 1 worker for now.
* big file improvements for lzip, lzo and 7z unpacking

2012-01-01
* change copyright statements
* extract strings from JavaScript files too
* sort scans for leafs first, so big files are scanned first
* send tasks to the pool in chunks of size 1, so each process in the worker
pool runs for roughly the same time.
* fix an error in the ranking code, which significantly speeds up the
algorithm...again
* tag bz2 and gzip files

2011-12-31
* parallellise leafscans. Especially when ranking is enabled this pays off a
lot and shaves off another 30% of runtime (even more if caches are hot). It
seems to be faster even when there is only one worker process in the pool. There
is one caveat: this will only work correctly if the caching database for the
ranking scan has been *FULLY* generated, or else it will try to write to the
database, which could lead to errors. The default process is therefore
hardcoded to 1, but this will be made configurable in the near future.

2011-12-28
* for some ext4 file systems tune2fs needs 8192 bytes to run correctly
2011-12-27
* unpack scans also can return tags

2011-12-25
* select scans based on the actual offsets that were found. Also make sure
that scans for which magic was found at offset 0 are tried first.

2011-12-24
* add a very simple verifyGraphics pre-run scan. Right now it only verifies if
a file is a JPEG file.
* always run the marker search program and no longer as an optional pre-run
scan. This also simplifies the other pre-run scans a bit.
* only run the marker searches for the magic types that are defined in the
configuration. This speeds up scanning a tiny bit.
* move code outside of loops in ranking scan, slashing runtime with an
additional 60%.

2011-12-23
* stubs for adding a 'noscan' directive that scans can use to say which
category of files they don't want to scan.
* move pre-run scans to separate file
* pre-run scans can return a list of tags. Right now it is just file type, but
they could be anything. The contents of the list of tags is compared to the
value of 'noscan' in the configuration file. If a tag can be found in the
'noscan' list, the scan is skipped. This way we have a fine grained model to
enable and disable scans for specific files.
* add prerun scan for verifying if a file consists of just printable text
characters

2011-12-22
* add extraction of PDFs

2011-12-21
* speedups in creation of temporary strings cache, which reduces runtime
vastly.
* enable new variant (realtek) of squashfs+lzma

2011-12-20
* avoid duplicated rows in the strings cache database for ranking. This can
save quite a bit of space.

2011-12-19
* for each file first determine it is a valid XML file, so other methods no
longer need to scan it. This is especially to prevent the ranking method from
scanning these files.
* add yet another squashfs+lzma variant to bat-extratools

2011-12-18
* rework extraction of ELF sections from ELF binaries. Just using 'strings'
got too many strings. The previous version of the extraction of the right
sections (using readelf -p) did not work, because readelf -p ate leading tabs
and converted them into spaces, so sometimes some strings were not matched
properly. Now we first cut the right ELF sections from the binary, then use
strings on the temporary binary, which gives much better results.

2011-12-17
* filter out scans we don't need to run anyway, removing the need to
dynamically load and eval() the code
* big file improvements for ICO scanning
* rework unpack scans: no longer return offsets, since only one of the prerun
scans scans for/alters those.
* ranking: if none of the strings we have for gains is significant enough we
should stop processing
* ranking: fix bug where only one result per string was fetched, which led to
vastly incorrect results.

2011-12-15
* big file improvements for squashfs, ARJ and ar
* simple scanner that looks for presence of strings that might indicate the
code was from a forge, like sourceforge or code.google.com. In the future it
might be good to use the scanner from FOSSology for this.
* very simplistic scanner for scanning for a few license identifiers. This is
*not* meant to obtain proof that a program is under GPL, just as an indicator
for further investigation.

2011-12-14
* big file improvements for lzma, serialized Java, RAR and ZIP
* replace using output of libmagic for determining device files, sockets, etc.
by using standard Python functionality
* big file improvements: use hardlinks instead of shutil.copy(). This will
give us some more improvements, since files don't need to be copied around.

2011-12-13
* stop unpacking a file when the whole file has been blacklisted
* remove duplicate code in bruteforce.py
* unpackGzip: don't read in a file and then write it out again if it is the
same data, but use shutil.copy() instead. Also write files out with dd instead
of reading the data ourselves. It is a lot more efficient. Finally don't read
the output of zcat, but write it to a file directly. This really pays off in
the case of big files.
* don't read in the file at once when determining the hash, because this will
be very resource intensive for large files.
* unpackTar: like unpackGzip: don't read a file, but use shutil.copy() and dd
instead. This pays off with big files.
* big file improvements for byteswap and iso9660 scanning, plus fix dd command
for gzip and tar
* big file improvements for ext2
* big file improvements for bzip2

2011-12-12
* add another squashfs+LZMA variant (for Atheros devices) to bat-extratools
* add unpacking for squashfs+LZMA variant for Atheros devices to squashfs
unpacking
* rework code for unpacking files that contain multiple zip files, almost done
* add workaround for certain files that contain multiple zip files. This
works for now, but it might be that we will need additional fixes in the
future.
* fix ranking bug that was triggered when there was a blacklist active
* fix unpacking code for unsquashfs (openwrt, lzma). When unqsuashfs tried to
unpack and tried to create inodes the scan thought unpacking had failed while
it was in fact successful.

2011-12-11
* if unyaffs seems successful, but actually does not unpack any data, it is
unsuccessful, so treat it as such.
* if zipinfo is unsuccessful we should bail out

2011-12-10
* add unpacking for 7z files, only when 7zip header can be found at offset 0,
until figured out what's safe (7z can unpack a lot more)

2011-12-08
* rework unpacking for GIF
* don't always create a temporary directory for 'byteswap', only when
necessary

* enable yaffs2 unpacking

2011-12-05
* remove unused database

2011-12-01
* don't follow symlinks for chmod
* unsquashfs from openwrt with lzma cannot unpack to an existing directory, so
use an extra directory to work around that limitation
* add alternative LZMA identifier that is sometimes used in OpenWrt, rework
LZMA unpacking to work with multiple identifiers

2011-11-25
* add jdeserialize to bat-extratools
* add unpacking for Java serialized files using jdeserialize

2011-11-01
* treat Groovy files as Java
* treat JSP files as Java

2011-10-30
* add dedexer to bat-extratools

2011-10-21
* add field 'envvars' to pass around extra information to scans. These should
be put into the environment in some cases (ranking scan)

2011-10-20
* add string constant extraction for Dalvik files, using dedexer. This needs
to be added to bat-extratools

2011-10-19
* add string constant extraction for Java class files, so we can do better
matching in the ranking code for Java.

2011-10-18
* release version 5.0
* release first version of bat-extratools, keep it in sync version wise with
BAT

2011-10-17
* RPM specfile fixes
* enable squashfs variants, plus fix bug in Squashfs LZMA (Broadcom variant)
* add Squashfs LZMA (slax.org/Ralink variant)
* add Debian package installation files for bat-extratools

2011-09-25
* add more documentation to the user guide

2011-09-24
* update version of Ninka that's used, also scan with FOSSology by default.
* scan .qml files and treat them as C

2011-09-23
* add unpack ZIP files to batchextractprogramstrings.py

2011-09-22
* add more sections to the user guide

2011-09-21
* started work on incorporating snippets of documentation into a comprehensive
user guide, giving it a much needed quality boost as well.

2011-09-20
* finished SWF unpacking. Right now it is assumed that the entire file is a
flash file and it's compressed.

2011-09-19
* finished JFFS2 support

2011-09-18
* start on JFFS2 unpacker that uses output from jffs2dump and carves the right
bits from the JFFS2 file. Far from finished, still needs work.

2011-09-17
* add stubs for unpacking of SWF files
* add mapping from extension to language as used in the database

2011-09-10
* if we have ELF files we can do a much better job at getting the strings from
the binary by just looking at a few sections which we can get using readelf.
All other files are still checked using the old 'strings' method.

2011-09-06
* rework splitting \r because it didn't work for various reasons. Also, we are
actually right now just interested in getting rid of \r\n in HTTP code.

2011-09-05
* add unpacking for base64 encoded files. This will not always work, because we
can't determine where a base64 encoded starts or ends.
* split at \r, similar to \n. The 'strings' command will split at either and
so should we to get better matches.
* remove double quotes before putting strings in database in case we are
processing a multiline msgid
* report amount of unique strings for ranking scan

2011-09-04
* add experimental virus scanning method using clamscan, just for Windows
executables
* fix offset for RAR endofarchive variable
* rewrite Zip processing code to new format. For some reason this was not done
yet :-/
* also rewrite RAR processing code to new format. For some reason this was not
done yet :-/

2011-09-02
* fix bugs in extraction code using xgettext
* store line numbers for extracted strings. This might come in handy in future
reporting.

2011-08-29
* ignore strings that will not significantly contribute to a score in the
ranking algorithm. This speeds up the algorithm by vast amounts.

2011-08-27
* add unpacking ar archives, such as Debian packages

2011-08-24
* replace homebrew string extraction code with a call to xgettext. It's
cleaner and gives better results. A small wrapper around it to parse output is
all that was needed.

2011-08-08
* fix InstallShield unpacking
* rewrite ARJ unpacking to new style unpacking

2011-08-07
* unpack .ico files
* start on unpacking InstallShield files. Unfortunately we can only process a
subset of files, because "unshield" can't process all files.

2011-08-02
* add scanning for ISO9660 file systems. Still need to determine the size of
the file system for the blacklist. This functionality needs FUSE and fuseiso.

2011-07-31
* move the RPM unpacking to an external file so BAT will not fail on systems
where there is no RPM Python and where unpacking RPM has been disabled.
* add identifiers for ISO9660

2011-07-26
* add mergeBlacklist method to merge sections in blacklists that overlap.

2011-07-17
* don't barf if we can't generate a proper LIST for the batch extraction
program

2011-07-16
* start on reimplementing ranking methods from MSR 2011 paper

2011-07-10
* introduce generic method to create directories with the right names
* rewrite most search* methods to use the prescanned offsets

2011-07-09
* (partial) rewrite to use seek() and read() for searching offsets instead of
first reading the entire file and then find()
* start on generic marker search, so we only have to read a file once, instead
for every 'unpack' scan we want to run

2011-06-19
* ugly byte swapping hack for Realtek RTL8196C based routers

2011-06-03
* start working on crawlers to help maintain archive of source code files that
are needed to create knowledgebases

2011-05-31
* add support for lzo unpacking

2011-05-30
* rework SquashFS code
* add length checking for cramfs for blacklisting

2011-04-28
* partially integrate preliminary support for extracted assemblies for
installers for Microsoft Windows

2011-04-27
* start on extracting XML descriptions from Windows installers so we can make
better guesses as to which program to use to unpack the data

2011-04-03
* add extra ext2 sanity checks to vastly speed up scanning

2011-03-26
* add proper ext2 unpacking
* add unpacking with unsquashfs with LZMA from OpenWrt

2011-03-14
* introduce wrapper for squashfs, so we can easily add other squashfs
unpackers too, plus fix some cleanup bugs for unpackSquashfs

2011-03-13
* add PNG unpacking
* fix tempdirs for ext2 unpacking

2011-03-06
* rework leaf scans to properly use blacklisting
* reenable ext2fs scanning

2011-03-05
* fold walktempdir() into scan()
* remove some clashes between names of variables and built-in function for
clarity

2011-03-04
* rework GIF scanning so we don't unnecessarily loop: merge searchUnpackGIF
and unpackGIF, add extra checks.

2011-03-02
* first copy the file to scan to the temporary scanning directory
* start on reworking hierachical unpacking which will make it easier to find
where and how things were unpacked.
* add more hierarchical unpacking
* unpack squashfs to the temporary directory directly, without having
unsquashfs create the 'squashfs-root' directory
* add speedups for GIF images, also fix a few indexing bugs, argh.

2011-02-28
* add a 'noscan' attribute for directories that don't need extra 'unpack'
scans for its contents
* add 'noscan' for unpacking GIF
* reenable GIF

2011-02-27
* disable GIF scanning due to endless looping. We should start marking certain
files as 'noscan' to avoid looping.
* add giflib-utils as a dependency for the RPM
* rework blacklisting, so we don't overload the datastructure for passing on
the results.
* remove Dutchims
* add yaffs2 unpacking, not enabled by default

2011-02-26
* don't exclude files to scan. The unpack scripts should be able to handle
this nicely.

2011-02-25
* don't clear the blacklist by accident
* start on extracting GIF images
* add extraction of GIF images
* fix another bug in blacklisting

2011-02-23
* fix some bugs in unpacking RAR
* rework scanning for EXE files. Currently only grabs files that can be
unpacked with RAR.
* add unpack7z for use in exe unpacking. Still need to rework generic 7z
unpacking itself.

2011-02-22
* rework unpacking for CAB
* give 7zip more priority than other scans such as CAB to prevent duplicate
scanning
* add blacklisting to 7z. This is very crude and needs to be reworked.

2011-02-21
* add unpacking for ARJ
* fix small bug in ubifs searching

2011-02-20
* fix XZ unpacking
* fix unsquashfs unpacking encountering a sqsh we can't unpack yet

2011-02-18
* change upperbound of blacklist checking from <= to <
* add lzip unpacking

2011-02-16
* add search method for XZ footer
* make lzip a dependency for the RPM
* start on XZ support. This does not yet work, so don't use.
* rework cpio unpacking slightly. There are still a few logic errors here that
need some love.

2011-02-15
* use 'file' to determine the size of squashfs file systems.
* introduce "genericSearch" and rewrite all checks in checks.py to use
genericSearch
* add stubs for XZ support
* small comment fixes and removal from dead code
* add stubs for lzip support

2011-02-13
* only pass data between cpio header and trailer to the cpio unpacker.
* start inlining methods in certain checks that don't have to be separate
* inline more methods, merge a few checks into one file
* add extra checks to cpio unpacking to ensure we are actually unpacking valid
cpio archives.

2011-02-12
* add proper options to license scanning program
* determine sha256 hashes for files scanned by license scanner
* fix cpio searching bug, might break some runs at the moment
* only license check certain files

2011-02-07
* move temporary directory creation into the while loop for
searching/unpacking gzip files to prevent duplicate scanning. This should be
done for other searches as well.
* add stub for adding directories containing the names of the compression to
make it easier to find things after a scan.
* move temporary dir creation into the while loop for most other scans as well

2011-02-06
* implement priorities for scanning, get rid of looping over configuration for
every scan, which was a bit silly.
* remove looping over configuration in XML printing
* small cleanups

2011-02-04
* add documentation for blacklisting
* add blacklisting for individual program scans

2011-02-03
* add blacklisting for tar, cpio and RPM

2011-01-30
* don't scan block devices or character devices
* don't enable ubifs, since I have not added the code yet :-/
* add code to store the configuration globally
* reenable ubifs
* add unpacker for ubifs, currently does not work correctly, but unpacks too
much. This needs to be fixed.
* fix unpacker for ubifs. Needs testing with more real data.
* remove temporary dirs in the bzip2 unpacker
* add stubs for working with priorities, as announced on the mailinglist
* make "config" global, eventually we will replace this with something else
that should significantly clean up the code

2011-01-29
* add -d to cpio, so it actually creates directories
* add unpacking RPMs. RPM contains a gzip file so we get some duplicates.
* actually enable bzip2 in the standard configuration, sigh.

2011-01-27
* add stubs for using Ninka to get licensing information per file

2011-01-26
* return the type of the squashfs file system we find. We don't yet use the
information, but eventually we will use it to choose the right unpacker for
squashfs, and be able to add some more meta information about what kind of
squashfs file system it is.
* update the README, it was still very old (and still can use cleanups)
* add mtd-utils-ubi as a dependency for the RPM (package name needs to be
checked for DEB)

2011-01-25
* cleanups
* add markers for ubifs (used a lot on Android)

2011-01-24
* (finally) add support for bzip2 archives

2011-01-20
* add option to switch between absolute and relative reporting of paths, to
make unpacked files easier to find in /tmp after a scan
* always report both absolute and relative paths, remove switch
* unpack into a single directory, instead of scattering things over lots of
directories in /tmp. This makes it easier to pack the results of a scan for
later analysis.

2010-10-08
* iconv fixes, some extra comments

2010-10-07
* rename unpack types in the bruteforce configuration
* replace per scan specific unpack elements with a generic "unpack" element, add
type of unpack to a new element "type", which specifies the type.
* extractprogramstrings.py: strip comments first, optionally run through
iconv first, make regex more reliable
* add public domain sed script that removes C/C++ style comments

2010-09-15
* store scanned strings to Lucene

2010-09-13
* start on a program to extract strings from sourcecode

2010-09-04

2010-06-17
* add configuration for BusyBox 1.16.2

2010-06-09
* add preliminary support for cramfs (only tested with little endian cramfs).
Some extra work is needed to get this to work (apply a patch, rebuild a tool),
so it is disabled by default for now.

2010-06-08
* compatibility fixes for unzip 6.0

2010-06-03
* reinstate 'magic' attribute in the configuration
* tool to extract information from the XML output and add it to knowledgebase

2010-06-02
* started work on a script to take the results from the output of the
bruteforce tool and put the results into the knowledgebase

2010-06-01
* add a simple check for hostapd
* add some more stubs for integrating the knowledgebase

2010-05-10
* add a simple check for wpa_supplicant
* use data from the knowledgebase to report additional data
* add a script to initialize a knowledgebase (sqlite) , as well as several separate
scripts to maintain the knowledgebase

2010-05-09
* add a script for creating a knowledgebase and fill it with some test data

2010-05-05
* add simple checks for iptables, iproute, dproxy, ez-ipupdate
* add simple check for libusb 0.1
* add simple check for vsftpd
* move documentation to the 'doc' directory
* document adding new checks

2010-05-04
* small speedup for BusyBox (40 characters should be enough for the BusyBox
version number)
* stub for XML reporting for BusyBox, not yet used
* cleanup fsmagic.py, add markers for cpio archives
* add beginnings of tools to build and query a searchbase with a file name to
package mapping, useful for quick sweep scanning
* make the tool run silent by default (no reporting)
* add reporting of bruteforce scanning in XML (enable with -x flag)
* remove old text reporting
* add infrastructure to have custom XML snippets printed for checks that don't
fit the default XML reporting model
* add unpack code for cpio, tar, Windows executables (cabinet archive files,
7z), rar, zip
* add code to determine architecture for ELF files
* document code more

2010-05-01
* remove some calls to addDocument() in the extractkernel* scripts, since they
are unnecessary. It also brings down the size of the Lucene indexes with about
a quarter, and lets the scripts run a bit faster.

2010-04-30
* remove a marker string for U-Boot which falsely identified some instances of
CFE as possibly U-Boot

2010-04-27
* add a check for loadlin, which you can still find in some embedded devices
* speedup for BusyBox version extraction
* speedup for Linux kernel version extraction

2010-04-26
* close files when we don't need them anymore. This prevents running out of
limits for open files.

2010-04-23
* add more documentation for the bruteforce scanning tool

2010-04-21
* add first scan for U-Boot. More marker strings need to be added to make it more reliable.

2010-04-18
* remove wrong marker line for ALSA, leading to false positives
* add LZMA decompression. This is not too reliable according to Debian bug #364260

2010-04-17
* add basic pretty printing
* speedup scanning for BusyBox version number
* Python 2.5 compatibility fixes (thanks to Brett Smith)
* only check for module license strings in actual modules
* return the correct offset for finding squashfs file systems
* filter out more files, that are not immediately interesting, like HTML pages
* add the kernel checks from the kernelanalysis script to the brute force scanner

2010-04-16
* add scan for RedBoot to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for wireless tools to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for dynamically linked libraries to brute force scanning tool
* add scan for licenses in kernel modules to brute force scanning tool

2010-04-15 - initial release
