2011-03-05
* fold walktempdir() into scan()
* remove some clashes between names of variables and built-in function for
clarity

2011-03-04
* rework GIF scanning so we don't unnecessarily loop: merge searchUnpackGIF
and unpackGIF, add extra checks.

2011-03-02
* first copy the file to scan to the temporary scanning directory
* start on reworking hierachical unpacking which will make it easier to find
where and how things were unpacked.
* add more hierarchical unpacking
* unpack squashfs to the temporary directory directly, without having
unsquashfs create the 'squashfs-root' directory
* add speedups for GIF images, also fix a few indexing bugs, argh.

2011-02-28
* add a 'noscan' attribute for directories that don't need extra 'unpack'
scans for its contents
* add 'noscan' for unpacking GIF
* reenable GIF

2011-02-27
* disable GIF scanning due to endless looping. We should start marking certain
files as 'noscan' to avoid looping.
* add giflib-utils as a dependency for the RPM
* rework blacklisting, so we don't overload the datastructure for passing on
the results.
* remove Dutchims
* add yaffs2 unpacking, not enabled by default

2011-02-26
* don't exclude files to scan. The unpack scripts should be able to handle
this nicely.

2011-02-25
* don't clear the blacklist by accident
* start on extracting GIF images
* add extraction of GIF images
* fix another bug in blacklisting

2011-02-23
* fix some bugs in unpacking RAR
* rework scanning for EXE files. Currently only grabs files that can be
unpacked with RAR.
* add unpack7z for use in exe unpacking. Still need to rework generic 7z
unpacking itself.

2011-02-22
* rework unpacking for CAB
* give 7zip more priority than other scans such as CAB to prevent duplicate
scanning
* add blacklisting to 7z. This is very crude and needs to be reworked.

2011-02-21
* add unpacking for ARJ
* fix small bug in ubifs searching

2011-02-20
* fix XZ unpacking
* fix unsquashfs unpacking encountering a sqsh we can't unpack yet

2011-02-18
* change upperbound of blacklist checking from <= to <
* add lzip unpacking

2011-02-16
* add search method for XZ footer
* make lzip a dependency for the RPM
* start on XZ support. This does not yet work, so don't use.
* rework cpio unpacking slightly. There are still a few logic errors here that
need some love.

2011-02-15
* use 'file' to determine the size of squashfs file systems.
* introduce "genericSearch" and rewrite all checks in checks.py to use
genericSearch
* add stubs for XZ support
* small comment fixes and removal from dead code
* add stubs for lzip support

2011-02-13
* only pass data between cpio header and trailer to the cpio unpacker.
* start inlining methods in certain checks that don't have to be separate
* inline more methods, merge a few checks into one file
* add extra checks to cpio unpacking to ensure we are actually unpacking valid
cpio archives.

2011-02-12
* add proper options to license scanning program
* determine sha256 hashes for files scanned by license scanner
* fix cpio searching bug, might break some runs at the moment
* only license check certain files

2011-02-07
* move temporary directory creation into the while loop for
searching/unpacking gzip files to prevent duplicate scanning. This should be
done for other searches as well.
* add stub for adding directories containing the names of the compression to
make it easier to find things after a scan.
* move temporary dir creation into the while loop for most other scans as well

2011-02-06
* implement priorities for scanning, get rid of looping over configuration for
every scan, which was a bit silly.
* remove looping over configuration in XML printing
* small cleanups

2011-02-04
* add documentation for blacklisting
* add blacklisting for individual program scans

2011-02-03
* add blacklisting for tar, cpio and RPM

2011-01-30
* don't scan block devices or character devices
* don't enable ubifs, since I have not added the code yet :-/
* add code to store the configuration globally
* reenable ubifs
* add unpacker for ubifs, currently does not work correctly, but unpacks too
much. This needs to be fixed.
* fix unpacker for ubifs. Needs testing with more real data.
* remove temporary dirs in the bzip2 unpacker
* add stubs for working with priorities, as announced on the mailinglist
* make "config" global, eventually we will replace this with something else
that should significantly clean up the code

2011-01-29
* add -d to cpio, so it actually creates directories
* add unpacking RPMs. RPM contains a gzip file so we get some duplicates.
* actually enable bzip2 in the standard configuration, sigh.

2011-01-27
* add stubs for using Ninka to get licensing information per file

2011-01-26
* return the type of the squashfs file system we find. We don't yet use the
information, but eventually we will use it to choose the right unpacker for
squashfs, and be able to add some more meta information about what kind of
squashfs file system it is.
* update the README, it was still very old (and still can use cleanups)
* add mtd-utils-ubi as a dependency for the RPM (package name needs to be
checked for DEB)

2011-01-25
* cleanups
* add markers for ubifs (used a lot on Android)

2011-01-24
* (finally) add support for bzip2 archives

2011-01-20
* add option to switch between absolute and relative reporting of paths, to
make unpacked files easier to find in /tmp after a scan
* always report both absolute and relative paths, remove switch
* unpack into a single directory, instead of scattering things over lots of
directories in /tmp. This makes it easier to pack the results of a scan for
later analysis.

* bump version number to 4.0

2011-01-13

2010-06-09
* add preliminary support for cramfs (only tested with little endian cramfs).
Some extra work is needed to get this to work (apply a patch, rebuild a tool),

2010-05-04
* small speedup for BusyBox (40 characters should be enough for the BusyBox
version number)
* stub for XML reporting for BusyBox, not yet used
* cleanup fsmagic.py, add markers for cpio archives
* add beginnings of tools to build and query a searchbase with a file name to
package mapping, useful for quick sweep scanning

fit the default XML reporting model

7z), rar, zip
* add code to determine architecture for ELF files
* document code more

2010-05-01
* remove some calls to addDocument() in the extractkernel* scripts, since they
are unnecessary. It also brings down the size of the Lucene indexes with about
a quarter, and lets the scripts run a bit faster.

2010-04-30
* remove a marker string for U-Boot which falsely identified some instances of
CFE as possibly U-Boot

2010-04-27
* add a check for loadlin, which you can still find in some embedded devices
* speedup for BusyBox version extraction
* speedup for Linux kernel version extraction

limits for open files.

* add first scan for U-Boot. More marker strings need to be added to make it more reliable.
