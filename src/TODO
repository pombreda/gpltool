TODO:

file systems:
* FAT
* NTFS

compression:
* rzip
* E00

string extraction:
* .txx (templates, see insight toolkit for examples)

queueing system:
* let top level script also read from a queue
* add script to add files to and remove files from scanning queue

parallel scanning:
* introduce new configuration parameter "parallel" that indicates whether or not a scan can be run as parallel (default: yes). This is to parallellise parts of BAT (such as unpacking), but leave other parts alone.

packing:
* introduce new configuration parameters that control which result files should be packed and where they should be written to
