TODO:

file systems:
* FAT
* NTFS
* ubifs (unubi was removed from mtd-utils)
* more generic YAFFS2 support

compression:
* rzip
* E00

queueing system:
* let top level script also read from a queue
* add script to add files to and remove files from scanning queue

aggregate scanning:
* aggregate ranking results for JAR file scanning
* cleanup if we used one of the squashfs + lzma variants where we can't determine the size.
* rework bat-findlibs to see if we have all dependencies of a program inside the firmware

GUI:
* rewrite to PyQt to take advantage of better rendering engine (webkit)

error handling:
* better handle errors to give users a better indication if something went wrong

function names:
* generate list of function names and where they were found, optionally with line numbers, for GUI

database creation:
* handle embedded archives (ZIP files, tarballs, etc.)
* handle patches
* extract method names from Java files
* extract constants from Java files
* extract constants from C files
* import licensing information from SPDX files
* rewrite ctags and xgettext invocations to scan multiple files at once to reduce overhead of calling ctags and xgettext

bat-extratools:
* add patches for CVE-2012-4024 for unsquashfs42

busybox scanning:
* clean up finding ranges of applets in extract_configuration. It should be possible to do this less kludgy.

HTML generation:
* finish function name reporting
* clean up/rewrite/make it easier to use
