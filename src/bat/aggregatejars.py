This plugin is used to aggregate ranking results for Java JAR files.
The ranking scan only ranks individual class files, which often do not
contain enough information. By aggregating the results of these classes
it is possible to get a better view of what is inside a JAR.

	## 1. checking the tags for 'zip'
	## 2. verifying for unpacked files that there are .class files
	## 3. possibly verifying there is a META-INF directory with a manifest
