  Brute force scanning

Top level reporting:
* cryptographic checksum (sha256) of the file
* file name of the scanned file
* scan date plus time

Per directory:
* full name of directory within the firmware
* file listing (similar to ls -laR) after unpacking (this might skip things like device files)

Per file:
* file name
* full path within the firmware
* file type (according to MIME)
* sha256sum
* libraries that are linked to (if the file is a dynamic library or binary)
* packages found in the binary
