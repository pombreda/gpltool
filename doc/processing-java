Processing Java files in the ranking module

We have chosen to treat Java and C executables in a different way. There are good reasons for this:

* strings that are very common in C programs might be very significant for Java programs or vice versa. If all strings would be used for all scans a string found in lots of C programs, but only one Java program, it would be considered irrelevant, even though it is very significant.
* although embedding Java in C programs and vice versa does happen it is not the most common situation

The database in the ranking module has a separate field 'language' where for each string that has been extracted the language of the file is recorded. The language is determined by looking at the extension of the file and using a special lookup table that maps extensions to a programming language.
