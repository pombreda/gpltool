Slide 2: The Binary Analysis Tool has a simple viewer that allows you to view
and browse results of a scan (stored as a tar archive) in a simple graphical
interface.

Slide 3: The BAT results viewer needs to be configured for some functionality
to work. The configuration file can either be loaded through the interface, or
be supplied on the commandline.

Slide 4: In the configuration file there is one section that is specific for
the viewer. Right now the only thing that is specifically for the viewer that
can be configured it is the location of a directory of pregenerated pretty
printed source code in HTML.

Slide 5: Opening a result file in the BAT results viewer is simple: via
File -> Open a file selection menu will be opened, after which a file can be
loaded. The results file will be unpacked. On the left there will be a file
tree that can be browsed, on the right results will be displayed in tabs.

Slide 6: Because not every file will be interesting it is possible to filter
uninteresting files from the file tree. Especially in larger firmwares, such
as Android images, there can be thousands of files, like graphics files or
text files or Android resource files, that are not directly interesting for
license compliance engineering, but which clutter the interface and which make
it easy to get lost in the amount of data.

The filter can be configured via Configuration -> Filter Configuration.

Slide 7: For each file a few attributes (as far as applicable) will be shown,
like size, checksum, tags, file name, and absolute and relative paths.
Depending on the file some other results (like scan results, architecture, list
of dynamically linked libraries) might be shown as well.
