\frametitle{Subjects}

In this course you will learn:

\begin{itemize}
\item examining individual files for clues of which software is being used
\item automated scanning of individual files with the Binary Analysis Tool
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Before we start}
It is important to keep in mind that this is only for finding evidence. Whether or not someone violates a license is a legal question, not a technical one.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Examining individual files}

\begin{itemize}
\item file type
\item dynamically linked libraries
\item extracting human readable strings
\item match strings extracted from binaries with source code
\item extracting function names from ELF executables
\item match function names extracted from binaries with source code
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Interesting files for compliance analysis}
There are various types of files we are interested in for license issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item executables (ELF, bFLT, Java, Windows executables)
\item libraries
\item Linux kernel images
\end{itemize}

Other files, such as audio, video or graphics, can be interesting too for trademarks, or licensing (Creative Commons).

\frame{
\frametitle{Determining file types}
You can make a good first guess with the \texttt{file} command, which uses the magic database using \texttt{libmagic}.

\texttt{libmagic} uses the so called magic database which is a description of all kinds of files. It is usually found in \texttt{/usr/share/magic} on Linux systems.

Use the \texttt{file} command to recognize various files on your system.

\frame{
\frametitle{Drawbacks of using \texttt{file} and \texttt{libmagic}}
There are some drawbacks of using commands like \texttt{file} or tools that use \texttt{libmagic}:

\begin{itemize}
\item the descriptions in the magic database can and will change over time and sometimes contains errors.
\item the magic database is not complete.
\item some file types don't have a fixed magic type.
\item not the entire file is considered, but just a number of bytes (up to a few hundred), so false positives can happen.
\end{itemize}

In BAT data from \texttt{libmagic} is mostly used for reporting, but not for searching and unpacking, just a few occassional verification steps.

\frametitle{Inspecting dynamically linked libraries}

In case the file is an ELF executable (executable program) or shared object (library for dynamic linking) ...

\frame{
\frametitle{Why not use \texttt{ldd}?}

One reason to not use \texttt{ldd} is that \texttt{ldd} uses the dynamic linker on the \textit{local} system to find dependencies.

It might seem that an executable or library is linked with a certain library, while in fact it is not and just a dependency on the \textit{local} system.

Another reason is that it will not work for executables that were compiled for a different CPU architecture.
