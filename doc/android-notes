Unpacking Android things

  File systems in use:

* yaffs2 (use unyaffs for this)
* ubifs (seen one example so far that had broken images)
* ext4 (soon, according to post that Ted Ts'o once did)
* possibly other file systems too

  Location of standard license texts

After unpacking firmware often a copy of the default Google terms of service can be found in /etc/NOTICE.html.gz. Sometimes additional files with extra license texts can be found.

  APK

Applications are in APK format:

unzip can handle these.

  Android resource files and XML files

AXMLPrinter2: http://code.google.com/p/android4me/downloads/list

  Dalvik files

Perhaps not really significant for compliance, but probably we can use dedexer.
